You do need to sacrifice battery capacity by a bit, though, as the Galaxy S21 only has a 4,000mAh cell. The rear is also made out of “Glasstic” rather than true glass.

                        Samsung has further innovated to make this phone-tablet hybrid a lot more versatile, thanks to a new Flex Mode. Plus, the multitasking is even better for running up to three apps at the same time, and several apps have a dual-pane view for enhanced productivity.">

On the top you’ll find a SIM slot, a hybrid power button and fingerprint sensor, and volume rockers. The fingerprint sensor is a welcome feature in theory, but it quickly becomes frustrating when using the Tab S7 in landscape mode, because it doesn’t work unless you contort your finger in a weird angle. 
                        The bottom of the tablet is home to a pogo pin connector and magnetic divots to keep a keyboard accessory in place, which looks a little clumsy compared with the iPad Air's clean lines. A pair of speakers sit on either side of the tablet, and there's a USB-C charging port on the right. In portrait mode, you’ll find a thin vertical camera module and a magnetic strip for the included S Pen on the back.">
