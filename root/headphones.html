The QC35IIs represent Bose’s flagship product, and the company’s attempt to perfect the active noise canceling technology they alone invented in the first place. Meaning: If your #1 goal is shutting off the outside world, stop reading, put a pair in your cart, and call it a day. The QC35IIs are wireless and extremely comfortable. And, like most wireless headphones, they do still come with a wire so you can continue listening even after the battery has been depleted, albeit sans noise cancelling. You can read more about the QC35II in our Best Over Ear Noise Canceling Headphones of 2021 guide. ">

Inside: Sony’s new Bluetooth chip, a 0.24 driver that’s tiny yet powers surprisingly big sound, an HD noise-canceling processor, a digital sound enhancement engine, 24-bit Audio Signal Processing and an excellent digital-to-analog converter. For you non-techy types, those features = excellent sound.
                        As for the outside, the XM3s are both ergonomical and comfortable – you may even forget you’re wearing them. They’re great for TV-watching, gaming, jogging, cooking and shutting out the world. And with Sony’s noise cancelling tech turned on, the XM3s are ideal for travel">

And we’re talking vibrant, natural bass, not the artificially boosted bass prominent in so many sports headphones. Bose patented acoustic ports and premium drivers work to make your music sound clear and balanced regardless of your volume settings.  And the StayHear™ Max ear tips don't just create an impressive acoustic seal, they keep your earbuds secure and comfortable, so they stay put no matter how intense your workout is. 
                    Also key to a great pair of workout earbuds: they're sweat and weather resistant - so they're super durable. Take calls easily with a click double-tap of the right earbud, or press and hold to reject it (perhaps our favorite feature when we're in the zone!). The simple and intuitive touch controls and 5 hours of playtime round out the features that secure this pair of true wireless earbuds in our top spot. Get caught without any battery power? Don’t worry. Just a quick 15-minute charge gives you up to two hours of playback time.">

                    data-content=" Bowers & Wilkins (B&W) is the luxurious, beautifully crafted, music-is-your-life alternative to industry mass producers like Sony and Bose. And though a pair of B&W PX7s is typically a little more expensive than Bose or Sony – and not as good at noise cancelation (though still excellent) – they soar, musically, by comparison. Some B&W fans claim their PX7s are on par with headphones that cost three and four times as much, and they may have a case.
                    The PX7’s ear-cups are made with memory foam and do a good job of walling-off noise from the outside world. The buttons are easy to find by feel, and they’re tactile as opposed to “touch,” which many customers prefer. Also, according to B&W, PX7s are the first headphones to support Qualcomm's aptxHD Adaptive codec, which is designed to deliver robust, low latency, high resolution wireless technology. Meaning: higher fidelity music overall (compared to Bluetooth) and no stalling when gaming or streaming hi-res, 4K video">

Featuring massive custom 40mm HD drivers, Sony ensured these over-ears deliver a clear and powerful soundstage. From the aluminum-coated LCP diaphragm to the silver-coated copper cables, it’s the finer details that work in tandem to deliver an audio experience that is precise, accurate, and as close to the artist’s original recording as possible. These cans were built for long listening sessions, thanks to its lightweight frame and pressure-relieving ear pads.
                    The MDR-1AMs feature a swivel design that allows them to lay flat and be tucked away in the included pouch. If you look closely, you’ll notice the grills have a Fibonacci-inspired pattern, which Sony says ensures no frequency is boosted or cut.">
