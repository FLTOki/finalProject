                <p>The iPhone 12 Pro is one of most feature-rich iPhones you can buy right now. <br> It has the greatest of all of Apple's features inside, and it's certainly the model to consider if you're questioning whether the iPhone 12 has enough raw power for you. <br>
                    Announced alongside the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 mini and iPhone 12 Pro Max, the key upgrades over the iPhone 12 are subtle: <br> 
                        <li>There's slightly more RAM, but the same chipset inside.</li>
                        <li>There are three camera sensors on the rear, not two, so you can now get closer to subjects and scenes with 2x optical zoom.</li>

                            <p>That said, compared to the last version of this model we reviewed in 2019, the new one has no concerns with its keyboard, excellent battery life, and even better performance. It’s an upgrade all around.
                             There’s a lot of technical detail to get into around the M1, how it handles running apps built for Intel chips, and what that tells us about the future of the Mac.
                             The short answer is that it’s very impressive, and the MacBook Pro is an excellent laptop with great performance and impressive battery life. </p>

                            <p>The Apple M1 is an ARM-based system on a chip (SoC) designed by Apple Inc. as a central processing unit (CPU) for its Macintosh computers and iPad Pro tablets. It was inspired by their Apple A14 Bionic chip.[4] The M1 is the first Apple-designed processor deployed in Macintosh computers,[5] and the first personal computer chip built using a 5 nm process. Apple claims that it has the world's fastest CPU core "in low power silicon" and the world's best CPU performance per watt.[4][6]
                                In addition to Apple's own macOS and iPadOS, support for the M1 architecture in the Linux kernel is forthcoming.</p>
